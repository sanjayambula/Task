Skildex is a campus-based skill exchange platform designed to help students connect, learn, and share knowledge with one another. 
The project currently includes a homepage introducing the platform, a login page for returning users, a registration page for new users,
and a dashboard where members can access their learning and teaching activities. 
The system is being developed step by step with a focus on clean design, easy navigation, and smooth user flow. At this stage, 
features like automatic redirection after registration, simulated authentication, and preparation for more advanced components such as skill listings, user profiles, and scheduling are being integrated.
The goal of Skildex is to create a professional, user-friendly platform that makes skill sharing within a campus both simple and impactful
